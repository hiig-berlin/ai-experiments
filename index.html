			<p>The earliest human traces in the area of modern Berlin are dated around 60,000 BC. A Mesolithic deer antler mask was dated around 9000 BC. During Neolithic times a large number of communities existed in the area and in the Bronze Age up to 1000 people lived in 50 villages. Early Germanic tribes took settlement from 500 BC. Slavic settlements and castles began around 750 AD.</p>

			<p>In the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the German Expressionist movement. In fields such as architecture, painting and cinema new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the First World War in 1918, a republic was proclaimed by Philipp Scheidemann at the Reichstag building. In 1920, the Greater Berlin Act incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city.</p>
