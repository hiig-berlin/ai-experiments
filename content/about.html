  <h1>About the project</h1>

  <p>
    On this website, we would like to give you an insightful look into the world 
    of artificial intelligence on the subject of facial recognition. For this 
    purpose we have designed two experiments on facial detection and facial 
    recognition as part of the research project Artificial intelligence, explained
    in human terms research project.

  </h3>

  <p>
    Find out whether your face is recognised as a face by the facial detection
    system using the camera on your laptop or on your mobile phone. In the experiment
    you can then try out how you can outwit the face detection system. Test how it
    reacts to different tricks, for example by covering your face or changing your
    perspective. Try out in which cases the system recognises a face better or worse.

  <p>
    For this experiment, we're going one step further with you. Explore whether the
    AI in this experiment accurately recognises your face in photos and which
    circumstances make this recognition better or worse. To do this, you can change 
    the lighting conditions or use a slightly different perspective. Upload several
    photos showing you in different stages of your life, or use images of other people
    who may resemble you. Can you trick the facial recognition system?

  <h3>Project Artificial intelligence, explained in human terms</h3>
  <p>
    This website was generated as part of the project
    <em>Artificial intelligence, explained in human terms</em>. The content was developed
    in a cooperation between the
    <a href="https://www.hiig.de/"
      >Alexander von Humboldt Institut für Internet und Gesellschaft (HIIG)</a
    > and the non-profit organisation
    <a href="https://www.neulandundgestalten.de/">neuland &amp; gestalten</a>.
    Jürgen Geuter, Director of Research at Art+Com explains in the following video (German).
