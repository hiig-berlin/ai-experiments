  <h1>Facial recognition</h1>
  <p>
    Here you can find out whether you can trick the face recognition system.
    The system recognises your face when it is highlighted in green. The
    percentage shows the exact probability of your face being recognised.

      Upload photos of yourself showing you at different stages of your life.
      This will help you determine whether the facial recognition system is
      able to identify you at different ages. Observe how the percentage
      changes and whether the system recognises you in different stages of life.

    </div>

    <div class="inner">
      <p>
      Use a picture in which several people look similar. The facial recognition
      system can easily be confused with similar faces. Test whether it can
      distinguish between similar faces. Pay attention to how the percentage 
      reacts and whether the system can correctly identify your face.

    <h3 class="heading">Multiple times, the same face</h3>
    <div class="image">

        alt="Viermal die gleiche Kopf-Silhouette"
      />
    </div>

    <div class="inner">
      <p>
      Use several photos of yourself in which your face appears multiple times.
      If the system is confronted with several identical faces, uncertainties may
      arise. Investigate which of your faces are better recognised and how you can
      influence this process. Note the changes in the percentage and the green
      markings.

    If you want to delve deeper into the topic of facial recognition, take a look at
    the video by J체rgen Geuter (German). Here he explains how the AI system behind
    this system behind this experiment works, in which areas it is used and what
    impact it has on our society.

    Enjoy experimenting and discovering! You are contributing to a better understanding
    of the opportunities and challenges of facial recognition as well as the impact
    of this technology on the world we live in.
