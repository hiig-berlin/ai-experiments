  <h1>AI explained in human terms</h1>

  <p>
    Explore the limits and possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI) using
    the example of facial recognition.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have developed two interactive experiments with which you can test the
    technology yourself using the camera of your computer or smartphone. In addition,
    we will explain how the AI systems behind our experiments work in two videos,
    and where they are already implemented in our society.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With this project, we want to provide access to the basic knowledge about artificial
    intelligence using the example of facial recognition. Your personal data will not be
    stored here and will be deleted once you close the browser; the use of the systems
    operates locally and is limited to your computer or your mobile phone.

  <p>Have fun experimenting and learning!</p>
